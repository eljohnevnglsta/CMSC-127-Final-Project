# Puntahe-Putahe

## Description

Puntahe-Putahe is a project for the CMSC 127: File Processing and Database Systems course at the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os. This project showcases students' mastery of Database Management Systems and the Structured Query Language. It is built using ReactJS, TailwindCSS, MariaDB, and Express.

## How to Run

### Install Dependencies

1. In your terminal, navigate to the backend folder and type: ```npm i```.
2. Then navigate to the frontend folder and type: ```npm i```.


### Run APIs and React App

1. Open a terminal dedicated to the server/database. Navigate to the backend folder and type: ```npm run dev``` or ```node index.js```.

2. Open another terminal dedicated to the React app. Navigate to the frontend folder and type: ```npm start```. It should automatically open a browser to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). If not, check if port 3000 is in use; the terminal will prompt you if you want to use another port.

### Database Initialization (Optional)

1. You may use the provided `script.sql` to set up the initial database schema and insert default data.
2. Open a MariaDB-supported terminal. Log in to your root account and type: ```source <path-to-script.sql>```. This will initialize the database with default data for testing.

### Enjoy and you may now start using the app
You may now start using the app. Note that there is no signup functionality, so a user must be added to the database manually. You may also check `script.sql` for a list of default data.
